# JSON Builder (JavaScript)

A dynamic web-based JSON builder that allows users to visually construct and export structured JSON data without writing raw code. Ideal for developers, testers, and data designers who need to quickly prototype or configure JSON objects.

## Technologies

- **React.js** *(optional)* – If applicable, used to manage components and state  

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Node.js & npm *(only if React or build tools are used)*

## Features
- Add/edit/delete key-value pairs
- Nest objects and arrays within the JSON
- Export to a downloadable `.json` file
- Real-time JSON preview
- Error handling for malformed structures
